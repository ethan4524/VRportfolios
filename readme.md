# Ethan Bowmar's VR Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my Unity portfolio repo. I had some trouble getting the Git ignore to work correctly, so please let me know how this repo looks! Thanks!

---

## Portfolio #1: Physics Materials - Bounce Demonstration

This portfolio showcases a Unity project that demonstrates how a RigidBody interacts with physics materials with varying bounciness.

---

## Portfolio #2: Render Textures with Multiple Cameras

In this portfolio, I showcase a Unity project that implements render textures with multiple cameras. This technique can be used to create effects like security camera systems.

---

## Portfolio #3: Projectile Instantiation and Color

This portfolio features a Unity project that covers prefab instantiation and a script that changes the color of an object upon being hit by a projectile.

---

## Portfolio #4: Character Controller Teleporter with Layer Mask and Projectile

In this portfolio, I discuss a technique to transform a player's location when a character controller is attached to a game object. The provided script allows us to shoot a projectile and teleport to the hit location, assuming it's on the specified layer mask.
